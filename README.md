# odin-recipes

Before starting:
The purpose of this Odin project is to use what I've learned thus far in HTML to make a basic webpage. I will build a basic recipe website. It'll look very basic, but will be styled with CSS in a later project. When done, I will have demonstrated my ability to write the HTML boilerplate and use elements such as headings, paragraphs, ordered and unorderd lists, links, and images.
