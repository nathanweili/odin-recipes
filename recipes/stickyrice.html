        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This Sticky Rice recipe is incredibly filling and can easily be served as a full meal. One of the many things I love about this recipe is how incredibly simple it is to make. </p>
            <p>My rendition of Instant Pot Sticky Rice is less than traditional, but I guarantee it's packed with flavors you'll love just as much as the original. I definitely made some simplifications when creating the recipe. I didn't use lotus leaves because they're not that easy to get ahold of, and I wanted a dish we could all make on a weeknight.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Glutinous rice</li>

                <li>Soy sauce</li>
                <li>Sesame oil</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
