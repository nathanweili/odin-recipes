        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This Sticky Rice recipe is incredibly filling and can easily be served as a full meal. One of the many things I love about this recipe is how incredibly simple it is to make. </p>
        <p>My rendition of Instant Pot Sticky Rice is less than traditional, but I guarantee it's packed with flavors you'll love just as much as the original. I definitely made some simplifications when creating the recipe. I didn't use lotus leaves because they're not that easy to get ahold of, and I wanted a dish we could all make on a weeknight.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Glutinous rice</li>
            <li>Oyster sauce</li>
            <li>Soy sauce</li>
            <li>Sesame oil</li>
            <li>Chicken broth</li>
            <li>Chinese sausage</li>
            <li>Shiitake mushrooms</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak the dried mushrooms in hot water while you prepare the rest of your ingredients.</li>
            <li>Add all of the ingredients to the Instant Pot liner, including the soaked mushrooms and stir.</li>
            <li>Cook under high pressure, and then allow it to release pressure naturally for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Release all remaining pressure.</li>
            <li>Remove the Instant Pot lid, stir well and allow to rest until the water or broth is completely absorbed.</li>
        </ol>
